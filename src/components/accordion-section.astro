          You can present about anything you want, as long as it's technical
          in nature, and you built or created it in some way.
        </li>
        <li>
          Presentations should be about 5 minutes long, but we might have time for more, depending on the number of presenters!
        </li>
        <li>
          Other than that, it can be anything you want – from functional
          programming, a neat AI tool you've been using, or about an
          <code class="italic">[insert niche topic here]</code> that
          you're really interested in.
